# Rate-my-pizza
This was a final project for a class heavily focused on web design using the basic tools: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even though it looks like a 90's 
website, I had a lot of fun with it. I also implemented php and mySql to it. Database design and management has always been a passion of mine.

Rate my Pizza was designed to be a social network, much like Instagram, where users could upload a picture of a delicious pizza they were eating. Other users
could like it or dislike it; captions, follows, location and statistics were implemented, as well as a personal profile page, other user profile page and a personal 
feed.
